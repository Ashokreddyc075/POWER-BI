There are two critical types of table relationships 
1. physical = relationships are manually created and visible in the data model
      Properties:
      ==========
      *  visible links between tables (1:* cardinality)
      *  can be active or inactive 
      *  can be accessed using dax functions (RELATED, RELATEDTABLE, USERELATIONSHIP.

2. virtual = relationships are temporary and defined using DAX Expressions 
 Properties:
============
*	Defined using DAX Expressions 
*	Used when a physical relationship does not exist or cannot be created directly.
*	Often used to connect tables with different levels of granularity.
* can be accessed using DAX functions like TREATAS
  
RELATED():
=========
Returns a value from a related table in the data model
		=RELATED(ColName)																							
ColName = Name of the column you want to retrieve values from (Must reference a table on the "one side" of many-to-one relationship) 

RELATEDTABLE():
==============
Returns a related table, Filtered so that only includes the related rows																							
			RELATEDTABLE(Table)
Table = Physical table you want to retrieve rows from (Must reference a table on the "many" side of a many to one relationship)																						
Its generally used with aggregators like countrows, sumx, avaragex
																							
USERELATIONSHIP():
=================
Specifies an existing relationship to be us
