To evaluate a single scalar value
SUMX():
======
Returns the sum of an expression evaluated for each row in a table 
=SUMX(TABLE,EXPRESSION)

 Iterator cardinality is the number of rows in the table being iterated. the more unique rows, the higher cardinality (this is different from relationship cardinality)
 when iterators reference a single table, cardinality is simply the number of unique rows.

when using nested iterations, cardinality depends on whether you are in physical or virtual relationships:
-> For a physical relationship, cardinality is defined as the max number of unique rows in the largest table
-> For virtual relationships cardinality is defined as the number of unique rows in each table multiplied together 

CONCATENATEX():
=============
Evaluates an expression for each row of the table and return the concatenation of those values in a single string, separated by a delimiter.
=CONCATENATEX(Table.Expression,[delimiter],[orderby_expression],[order])

AVERAGEX()
==========
Calculate the average of a set of expressions evaluated over a table
=AVERAGEX(Table,Expression) 
EX:
==
              Average Daily Sales = 
              AVERAGEX(
                  'Calendar',
                  [Customer Sales]
              )
